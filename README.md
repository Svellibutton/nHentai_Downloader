NOTES: 
This is a ChatGPT reproduction of some of the base features from the previous NHentai downloader created by Xwilarg which is available at https://github.com/Xwilarg/NHentaiDownloader. I am in no way affiliated with Xwilarg and provide all credit to the layout and featureset to the original developers. IF/When the original is updated to support Manifest V3, I will be taking this down and redirect all traffic to the previous extension. 

Currently this has only been tested on the most recent version of Chrome: Version 140.0.7339.128
